# FizzBuzz Exercise

I remember playing FizzBuzz in primary school. You had to work it out in your _head_! What a lot of effort... good job we have computers to do such heavy lifting nowadays.

## Part 1: What happens when bees drink lemonade?

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. If a number is a multiple of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number. If the number is a multiple of five print "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

Once you're happy with your solution, show it to your trainer and get some feedback. 

## Part 2: What are the bees up to now!?

FizzBuzz is pretty simple as programs go. But it's interesting to see what happens if you try adding new rules. Work through these in order, adding one at a time. How easy is it? How neat and tidy is the resulting code? Can you make changes to your program to make these sorts of enhancements easier, or cleaner?

If a number is a multiple of 7, print "Bang" instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of seven and three / five, append "Bang" to what you'd have printed anyway. (E.g. 3 * 7 = 21: "FizzBang").

If a number is a multiple of 11, print "Bong" instead of the number. Do not print anything else in these cases. (E.g. 3 * 11 = 33: "Bong")

If a number is a multiple of 13, print "Fezz" instead of the number. For multiples of most other numbers, the "Fezz" goes immediately in front of the first thing beginning with B, or at the end if there are none. (E.g. 5 * 13 = 65: "FezzBuzz", 3 * 5 * 13 = 195: "FizzFezzBuzz"). Note that "Fezz" should be printed even if Bong is also present (E.g. 11 * 13 = 143: "FezzBong")

If a number is a multiple of 17, reverse the order in which any fizzes, buzzes, bangs etc. are printed. (E.g. 3 * 5 * 17 = 255: "BuzzFizz")

You will obviously need to display more than 100 numbers in order to test out some of these later cases. How high do you need to go?

How much of a mess has your code become - how can you make it clear what's supposed to be happening in the face of so many rules?

## Stretch Goals

Try these if you finish early or want to challenge yourself in your spare time.

### Prompt the user for a maximum number
Read a value in from the console, then print up to that number.

### Allow the user to specify command-line options
Let the user pass in which rules to implement (e.g. any combination of 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17) as a command line parameter (or via some other means of your choice).

### Triangle time
If a number is a [triangle number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number), change all of the fizzes, buzzes, bangs, etc. to begin with the letter "T".

### Write some unit tests
Talk to your trainer for help if you get to this point.
